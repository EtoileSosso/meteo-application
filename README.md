# meteo
## A application I've made for my studies, its purpose is to first display the meteo based on your localization, you can next choose the place which you want to display, the searchbar will autocomplete itself thanks to the Google Maps API.
## Please think about installing node.js and git on your computer before you start the project
## First of all, go to the repository you want the project in by using cd on your command interface, then clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/Sosso-RB/meteo-application
git cd meteo-application
```

## Next, follow the following instructions

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
